          <p>Hi! I'm Reynante F. Madronio Jr. I'm 20 years old, born on July 18, 2003. I am The second born among the three of us, and the only son in our family. I have a younger sister, aged 8, and an older sister, aged 26. I am labeled as the black sheep in our family because I do not agree with my family's perspective of how things are and how things should be, one could say I am rebellious, and I would not deny it. Although I am not particularly in good terms with my parents, I don't hate them either, rather, I greatly respect them, especially my Mother because of her hardwork. Despite being a black sheep of the family, I am an over-protective brother especially to my little sister. <br><br>My motto in life is 'Hakuna Matata' which means 'No Worries' because in life, we encounter a lot of trouble, and when we worry, we make it double, which is why I try to avoid worrying about my problems as much as possible. Whenever I face hardships or know that I'm about to go through problematic situations, I tell myself "Hakuna Matata" then run head first into the problem and look for solutions along the way. That's the way I live.</p>
